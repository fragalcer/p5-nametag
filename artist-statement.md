Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

what are you trying to achieve with your name tag as a work of art?

I love cool designs and images with vivid colours. I used
the font "KUST" because I wanted to write my name with a brush stroke.
The use of Geometric patterns and mathematical principles makes this design unique and original.
I believe this name Tag represents my personality and communicates positive vibes.
